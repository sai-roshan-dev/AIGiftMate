# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Server Startup

The server listens on the configured port (default 5000) and connects to MongoDB at startup. Middleware includes CORS setup to allow requests from your frontend domain.

Run the backend server with:

```bash
npm start
```

You should see a console message like:

```bash
Server is running on http://localhost:5000
```

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sai-roshan-dev/AIGiftMate.git
cd AIGiftMate
```

### 2. Backend Setup

```bash
cd server
npm install
```

* Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory and add your environment variables:

```env
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
JWT_SECRET=a_strong_secret_key
UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY=your_unsplash_api_key
```

* Seed the database with product mock data (optional):

```bash
node scripts/seedProducts.js
```

* Start the backend server:

```bash
npm start
```

### 3. Frontend Setup

Open a **new terminal** window:

```bash
cd ../client
